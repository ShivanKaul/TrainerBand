MITHacks-WorkoutBand
====================

We used an Arduino Uno hooked up to the Triple-axis Accelerometer+Magnetometer (Compass) Board - LSM303 to explore the idea of using Jawbone UP wristbands (or any smart band with embedded accelerometer/compass) for more efficient workouts. The sensors would tell the user if his or her grip was incorrect, and extensive data on the workout would be provided.

We coded in C (for the Arduino interface) and Python (for the high-level processing) for over 25 hours non-stop (substituting sleep for caffeine+pizza) to achieve this. The experience was especially interesting given that none of us had any prior experience with hardware hacking.
